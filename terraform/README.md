# What is Terraform?

HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem
resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can 
then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its 
lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources,
as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

# How does Terraform work?

Terraform creates and manages resources on cloud platforms and other services through their application 
programming interfaces (APIs). Providers enable Terraform to work with virtually any platform or service 
with an accessible API.
